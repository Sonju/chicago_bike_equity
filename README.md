# Chicago Bike Lane Equity #
Visualization and analysis of Chicago bike lanes. An effort to determine how the bike lane installations are divided among the entire city. Are they distributed equally or equitably?

### Problem

Bicycle infrastructure is inequitably distributed in Chicago. And, as a result, Black, Brown, and LMI communities/residents are cut-off from all the various, inherent benefits from the activity of cycling.

### Thesis

Our goal is equal bicycle usage across neighborhoods in Chicago. In other words, through the use of data, we are working to achieve the same number of people in Englewood riding a bike as the number in Wicker Park. We believe we get there by investing comparatively more in bike infrastructure​ installations, encouragement/education programs, and telling a comprehensive bikeability/liveability ​story​ to elected officials, community leaders, & residents - all in Black, Brown, & LMI neighborhoods across the City, than what is invested in predominantly white or middle- to upper-income communities. Slow Roll Chicago will take the lead on ​encouragement​/education programs​ and telling a comprehensive ​story about the value of strong bike communities. The Transit Group of Open Gov Hack Night will take the lead on using data to make a rational yet compelling case to the City and State that bicycle infrastructure in Chicago is inequitably distributed and call for higher levels of infrastructure investment in underserved communities. 

### Data
 
_We currently have this data:_
* bike mode share (Transitized)
* bike routes (Chicago GitHub)
* race, ethnicity, population, income (Census, prepared by Daniel Hertz)
* ward and community area boundaries (City of Chicago data portal)
* Divvy stations
* land use (from CMAP)
* 

_We currently need this data:_
* transit accessibility index (TAI) from CMAP​ (Oboi & Martin Menninger)

### Goals

* Create a layered map to show the reality of bike infrastructure distribution in Chicago. Use ​these visuals to determine next steps. Before​ we publish the data, we will involve a ​few more groups to get feedback. Example: [Transitized How Chicago Commutes Map](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.transitized.com%2Fcommute%2F%2312%2F41.8990%2F-87.6397&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNEg7t_AywSwrRLJMEpVayrRSCd6Kw). 
* Create an equity index. 
* Integrate the data and visuals on the Slow Roll Chicago website
* Analyze the data and produce a report for each Chicago ward, determining "here's where you're at, here's what you need to do".
* Create a presentation​, perhaps for the March Mayor's Bicycle Advisory Council.
* Model the potential benefits of biking ​at the hyperlocal local level. Answer the question, "if this many more people started biking here​ are the results, such as new retail businesses​, violence prevention, economic development, healthier lifestyles, job​ creation, and higher property values".​​​

### Involve other people and groups
* CNT: ???
* CMAP: Martin Menninger, Noel Paterson, Tom Murtha, John Oneal
* Active Transportation Alliance: Melody Geraci
* Chicago Cycling Club: ???
* Chicago Black Bike Coalition: Slow Roll Chicago, Major Taylor Cycling Club of Chicago & Friends of the Major Taylor Trail
* SRAM: Randy Neufeld
* Neighborhood Associations & Community Organizations

* Supportive Aldermen

### Community Barriers to Address

* Focus needs to be on violence prevention
* More jobs is a more important issue
* Less parking is an inconvenience
* Gentrification is coming
* Perception of biking (white, children, spandex​ wearers​, poor​ people​)
